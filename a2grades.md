## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (60)

1. [5/5] Saving and loading data. File-Save can be used to save the model and File-Load can be used to load and restore the shapes that were saved. The user should be promoted for a file-save location using a JDialog.


2. [2/2] File-New can be used to discard the current document and create a new blank document.


3. [3/3] Selection tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar then click on a shape to select it. There should be some visual indication which shape is selected. Pressing ESC on the keyboard will clear shape selection.


4. [2/2] Erase tool. The user can select this tool in the toolbar then click on a shape to delete it.

11. [7/7] Line thickness palette. Displays at least 3 line widths, graphically, and allows the user to select line width for new shapes.

12. [2/2] Selecting a shape will cause the color palette and line thickness palette to update their state to reflect the currently selected shape.

## LAYOUT (15)

1. [1/1] The starting appication window is no larger than 1600x1200.


2. [4/4] Swing widgets are used appropriately to implement the window layout.


3. [5/5] The application should support dynamic resizing of the window. The tool palettes should expand and contract based upon available space, and they should remain usable at all times.

4. [5/5] If the user resizes the window smaller than the canvas, scrollbars should appear.


## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND MVC (15)

1. [5/5] Makefile exists, `make` and `make run` works successfully with default arguments.


2. [10/10] Model-View-Controller (MVC) used effectively (i.e. shape model contained in a model class, at least two views used to represent the canvas and/or toolbars).


## ADDITIONAL/BONUS FEATURES (10 + 10 optional bonus)

1. [0/10] Application incorporates one or more enhancements totaling 10%, as described in the requirements.


2. [10/10] Bonus feature: Resizing. The user can toggle between scaling the canvas full-size, or scaling the canvas and its contents to the window. The "Full size" mode is like the default (the canvas and its contents remain the same size as you resize the window, and scrollbars appear to let you scroll the image). In the "Fit to Window" mode, the canvas and its contents resize to fit the window as the window is resized.
